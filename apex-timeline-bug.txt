Also encountered this issue with rangeBar. toRaw() does solve the error but because my data is retrieved asynchronously, the graph wouldn't display since toRaw() disables Vue's reactive behaviour.

I worked around this new issue by following this trick; ie:

I added a :key="refreshKey" attribute to the <apexchart> component
Declared as const refreshKey = ref(0)
Once the data is available and has been inserted into the chart's series structure, simply increment the trigger as refreshKey.value += 1
